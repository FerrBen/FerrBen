# Hey, I'm Ferro

Developer turned indie maker. I build software products, ergonomic split keyboards, and share what I learn along the way.

```
Building in public | Shipping fast | Staying lean
```

## What I'm Building

**[Lynq.ink](https://lynq.ink)** - Link-in-bio tool for creators. Fast, customizable, no BS pricing.

**[File Sorter](https://ferrben.com/file-sorter)** - macOS utility for automatic file organization. My first product with paying customers.

**Split Keyboards** - Custom ergonomic keyboards for developers who care about their wrists.

## Tech I Work With

```
TypeScript    React       Next.js      SvelteKit
Node.js       PostgreSQL  Tailwind     Vercel
Swift         Stripe      Prisma       Railway
```

## The Approach

- **Ship fast** - Perfect is the enemy of done
- **Solve real problems** - Build what people need, not what sounds cool
- **Stay lean** - Bootstrap, keep costs low, focus on profit
- **Share openly** - Document wins, losses, and everything between

## Current Status

```diff
+ 2 products live
+ Building in public
! More in the pipeline
```
